<h2>Basic Terminology</h2>

<dl>
<dt>Gender:</dt> <dd>A social combination of identity, expression, and social elements in relation to masculinity and femininity. Potentially includes social gender (social expectations), gender roles (socialized actions), and gender attribution (social perception).</dd>
<dt>Gender identity:</dt> <dd>how a person identifies their own gender.</dd>
<dt>Sex:</dt> <dd>Socially constructed categories of people defined by common groupings of various biological distinctions (hormones, genitals, body hair, voice range, etc.)</dd>
<dt>Sex binary:</dt> <dd>the social reinforcement that there are only two acceptable sexes → Female and Male.</dd>
<dt>Intersex:</dt> <dd>Umbrella term for a variety of biological conditions in which a person is born with sex characteristics that do not conform to socially constructed categories of anatomical sex, h*rm*phr*d*te is a slur.</dd>
<dt>Micro-aggressions:</dt> <dd>The everyday verbal, nonverbal, and environmental slights, snubs, or insults, whether intentional or unintentional, which communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative messages to target persons based solely upon their marginalized group membership.</dd>
<dt>Phobia:</dt> <dd>Hated/intolerance/bigotry/micro-aggressions toward people of specific identities. Ex: Acephobia, Biphobia, Homophobia, Lesbophobia, Transphobia.</dd>
<dt>Ally/advocate:</dt> <dd>A person who confronts oppression/oppressive behaviors against marginalized groups the person isn’t in.</dd>
<dt>Coming Out:</dt> <dd>Acknowledgment of one’s orientation and identity. Someone discloses their identity in varies ways, such as, verbally.</dd>
<dt>Gender Expression/Presentation:</dt> <dd>The physical manifestation of one’s gender identity through clothing, hairstyle, voice, body shape, etc. (typically referred to as masculine or feminine). Many transgender people seek to make their gender expression (how they look) match their gender identity (who they are), rather than their sex assigned at birth. Someone with a gender nonconforming gender expression may or may not be transgender. *Some people don’t use clothing/body language/etc. to express gender.</dd>
<dt>Sex Assigned at Birth:</dt> <dd>The assignment and classification of people as male, female, intersex, or another sex assigned at birth often based on physical anatomy at birth.</dd>
<dt>Sexual Orientation:</dt> <dd>A person’s physical, romantic, emotional, aesthetic, and/or other form of attraction to others. In Western cultures, gender identity and sexual orientation are not the same. Trans people can be straight, bisexual, lesbian, gay, asexual, pansexual, queer, etc. just like anyone else. For example, a trans woman who is exclusively attracted to other women would often identify as lesbian.</dd>
<dt>Attraction:</dt> <dd>The action or power of evoking interest, pleasure, or liking for someone or something.</dd>
<dt>Transition:</dt> <dd>A person’s process of developing and assuming a gender expression to match their gender identity. Transition can include: coming out to one’s family, friends, and/or co-workers; changing one’s name and/or sex on legal documents; hormone therapy; and possibly (though not always) some form of surgery. It’s best not to assume how one transitions as it is different for everyone.</dd>
<dt>Transsexual:</dt> <dd>A deprecated term that is often considered pejorative similar to transgender in that it indicates a difference between one’s gender identity and sex assigned at birth. Transsexual often – though not always – implicates hormonal/surgical transition from one binary gender (male or female) to the other. Unlike transgender/trans, transsexual is not an umbrella term, as many transgender people do not identify as transsexual. When speaking/writing about trans people, please avoid the word transsexual unless asked to use it by a transsexual person.</dd>

<dt>Agender:</dt> <dd>An umbrella term encompassing many different genders of people who commonly do not have a gender and/or have a gender that they describe as neutral.

<dt>Gender Identity Disorder / GID:</dt> <dd>A controversial DSM-III and DSM-IV diagnosis given to transgender and other gender-nonconforming people. Because it labels people as “disordered,” Gender Identity Disorder is often considered offensive. The diagnosis is frequently given to children who don’t conform to expected gender norms in terms of dress, play or behavior. Such children are often subjected to intense psychotherapy, behavior modification and/or institutionalization. This term was replaced by the term &quot;gender dysphoria&quot; in the DSM-5.</dd>
<dt>Femme:</dt> <dd>An identity or presentation that leans towards femininity. Femme can be an adjective (he’s a femme boy), a verb (she feels better when she “femmes up”), or a noun (they’re a femme). Although commonly associated with feminine lesbian/queer women, it’s used by many to describe a distinct gender identity and/or expression, and does not necessarily imply that one also identifies as a woman or not.</dd>
<dt>Gender Affirming Surgery; Genital Reassignment/Reconstruction Surgery; Vaginoplasty; Phalloplasty; Metoidioplasty:</dt> <dd>Refers to surgical alteration, and is only one part of some trans people’s transition (see “Transition” above). Only the minority of transgender people choose to and can afford to have genital surgery. The following terms are inaccurate, offensive, or outdated: sex change operation, gender reassignment/realignment surgery (gender is not changed due to surgery), gender confirmation/confirming surgery (genitalia do not confirm gender), and sex reassignment/realignment surgery (as it insinuates a single surgery is required to transition along with sex being an ambiguous term).</dd>
<dt>Drag:</dt> <dd>Exaggerated, theatrical, and/or performative gender presentation. Although most commonly used to refer to cross-dressing performers (drag queens and drag kings), anyone of any gender can do any form of drag. Doing drag does not necessarily have anything to do with one’s sex assigned at birth, gender identity, or sexual orientation.</dd>
<dt>Bottom Surgery:</dt> <dd>Genital surgeries such as vaginoplasty, phalloplasty, or metoidioplasty.</dd>
<dt>Butch:</dt> <dd>An identity or presentation that leans towards masculinity. Butch can be an adjective (she’s a butch woman), a verb (he went home to “butch up”), or a noun (they identify as a butch). Although commonly associated with masculine queer/lesbian women, it’s used by many to describe a distinct gender identity and/or expression and does not necessarily imply that one also identifies as a woman or not.</dd>
<dt>Cross-dressing (also crossdressing):</dt> <dd>The act of dressing and presenting as a different gender. One who considers this an integral part of their identity may identify as a cross-dresser. &quot;Transvestite&quot; is often considered a pejorative term with the same meaning. Drag performers are cross-dressing performers who take on stylized, exaggerated gender presentations (although not all drag performers identify as cross-dressers). Cross-dressing and drag are forms of gender expression and are not necessarily tied to erotic activity, nor are they indicative of one’s sexual orientation or gender identity. Do NOT use these terms to describe someone who has transitioned or intends to do so in the future.</dd>
<dt>Aromantic:</dt> <dd>The lack of romantic attraction, and one identifying with this orientation. This may be used as an umbrella term for other emotional attractions such as demiromantic.</dd>
